## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge provided valuable practice for my coding skills, particularly in styling backgrounds and images.

```css
header::after {
  background-size: 220.5%;
  background-position-x: 25.3%;
  background-position-y: 52.16%;
}
``` 

### Continued development

I intended to add features that close one submenu when another is opened, but I forgot to implement this.
